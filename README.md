Hi everyone, this repo is my first repo on GitHub. I am undertaking a cool course at **University of Auckland** called **Stats220**
In order to pass this course with excellence, I need to demonstrate the following qualities:
   1. Undertake a broad variety of data science tasks
   2. Demonstrate understanding of programming concepts and skills associated with importing, wrangling and visualizing data for decision-  
   making, using R
   3. Describe tidy data principles, grammar of data manipulation, and grammar of graphics
   4. Develop communication skills, including using reproducible reporting with R Markdown
   5. Select and combine a range of data technologies, including HTML and CSS for reporting and web scraping
   6. Apply the good practice of project-oriented workflow and data-related responsibilities including ethical considerations

Apart from this course, I am also enrolled in the following other courses in this semester:
