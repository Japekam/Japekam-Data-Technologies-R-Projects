## Explanation

This redemption project aims to regain the marks that I lost in Project 2 by addressing the specific issue of not using response validation in numeric responses. This project also includes new visualizations with correct color themes(I tried my best ðŸ˜ƒ) and detailed descriptions to redeem the marks that I lost in Project 4.

## ***Marks Lost and Redemption***

***In Project 2***, I lost a mark for not enabling response validation on numeric responses in the Google Form. To address this, I have created a new Google Form titled "Weekly Music Consumption Survey" with proper response validation.

You can view the form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdMmRyxCNBNAiN-1Ke_K41XrLQdIjfiNb--FBxB1ClV4MgypA/viewform?usp=sf_link).

***In Project 4***, I lost marks for not using the correct color theme and not describing what my visualizations show. To rectify my mistake, I added a title and a subtitle in all the new plots that I created. I also changed the color theme and used this [website](https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/color-palettes-for-websites?gclsrc=aw.ds&gclid=Cj0KCQjwpNuyBhCuARIsANJqL9MjQwixsPKuVWYuPTthJ-p-Z6kiGtZqfwKMd7M7qSCmyQWrbu0QCQAaAr_vEALw_wcB&kw=&gad_source=1) to get references for my color pallete as suggested by Anna! For my ggplot color changes, I used scale_fill_manual and scale_color_manual functions. For creativity, I saw all the logos of the music streaming platforms and used their primary color to represent them.

P.S - I did not lose a mark for not echoing my css chunk in project 4, but I was told to follow the instruction(in the rubric). Now, I have made the required change.ðŸ˜ƒ

The following section includes new visualizations with the specified color theme and detailed descriptions.
